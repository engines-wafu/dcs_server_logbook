        <h2 class="airforce-blue">Logo</h2>
        <img src="img/JSWNEW2.png" alt="Joint Strike Wing Logo" style="width: 200px;">
        <p>The Joint Strike Wing logo is a core element of our identity. Use the logo as it appears here; do not modify or alter the logo in any way. The logo should not be compressed, stretched, or skewed. Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo, equivalent to the height of the 'W' in the logo, to ensure its visibility and impact.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 class="rifle-green">Color Palette</h2>
        <p>Our color palette is a key component of our brand identity. Use the following colors consistently across all media.</p>
        <div>
            <span class="navy">Navy: #000080</span><br>
            <span class="airforce-blue">Air Force Blue: #5d8aa8</span><br>
            <span class="rifle-green">Rifle Green: #4e5b31</span><br>
            <span class="crimson">Crimson: #c8102e</span><br>
            <span class="amber">Amber: #ffb20f</span><br>
            <span class="slate-gray">Slate Gray: #848482</span>

    <section>
        <h2 class="crimson">Typography</h2>
        <p>The typography system for the Joint Strike Wing gaming group uses three typefaces: Ungap, Benelux Medium, and Perpetua Std Titling Light. </p>
        <div>
            <h3 class="navy">Headings</h3>
            <p class="accent">Ungap should be used for all headings. It provides a strong, clear presence that supports our commanding brand voice.</p>
            
            <h3 class="airforce-blue">Body Text</h3>
            <p>Benelux Medium and Medium Oblique should be used for all body text. They offer excellent readability and versatility in both digital and print formats.</p>
            
            <h3 class="rifle-green">Accent Typeface</h3>
            <p class="accent">Perpetua Std Titling Light is to be used sparingly as an accent typeface for pull quotes, callouts, or for specific navigational elements where a touch of elegance is required.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 class="amber">Usage of Typefaces</h2>
        <p>Our typefaces should be used in a way that maintains legibility and hierarchy. Always ensure that text is easily readable on any background color. Avoid using the accent typeface for lengthy text.</p>
        <div>
            <h3 class="navy">Headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.)</h3>
            <p>Use 'Ungap' for all headers. Maintain adequate spacing between letters and ensure contrast with the background.</p>

            <h3 class="airforce-blue">Paragraphs and Body Text</h3>
            <p>For paragraphs, use 'Benelux Medium'. For emphasized text within paragraphs, use 'Benelux Medium Oblique'.</p>

            <h3 class="rifle-green">Accent Text</h3>
            <p>Use 'Perpetua Std Titling Light' for accentuating specific text elements such as quotes, important notices, or calls to action. This typeface should be used at a larger size to create impact.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2 class="slate-gray">Web and Digital Use</h2>
        <p>When applying our branding guidelines to web and digital platforms, ensure that all elements are optimized for screens. This includes retina displays and various device sizes. Use SVG formats for the logo to ensure it scales without loss of quality. Colors may display differently on screens; always check for color consistency across different devices.</p>

            <div>
        <h3 class="navy">Responsive Logo</h3>
        <p>The logo should remain clear and legible at all scales. Provide alternative logo arrangements for small screen sizes if necessary.</p>

        <h3 class="airforce-blue">Color Contrast and Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Ensure there is sufficient color contrast between text and background colors, keeping accessibility in mind. Text should be easily readable by everyone, including individuals with visual impairments.</p>

        <h3 class="rifle-green">Typography on Web</h3>
        <p>Ensure that the typefaces used are legible on screens. Fonts should be embedded correctly and fallback fonts should be specified in CSS. For Ungap and Benelux Medium, ensure that web font versions are used to prevent any rendering issues.</p>
